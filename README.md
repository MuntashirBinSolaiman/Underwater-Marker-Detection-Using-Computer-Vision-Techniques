# Underwater-Marker-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision-Techniques
This project aims to detect underwater markers using computer vision. It involves using a segmentation model for marker identification, applying binarization for ground truth, and designing a lightweight CNN or transformer model to automate marker detection, enhancing underwater photogrammetry and mapping accuracy
