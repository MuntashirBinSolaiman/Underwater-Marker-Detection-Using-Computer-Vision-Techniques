# Underwater Marker Detection Using Computer Vision for Climate Change Monitoring

## What
This ongoing project focuses on detecting underwater markers in images to monitor and track environmental changes related to climate change. By identifying markers in underwater environments, we aim to measure shifts in their positions, which can indicate changes in sea levels, coral reef health, and overall environmental conditions.

## How
1. **Segmentation Foundation Model**: A segmentation model is used to identify underwater markers in images.
2. **Binarization**: Segmentation results are binarized to generate ground truth labels for model training.
3. **Marker Detection Model**: A custom CNN/Transformer-based model is developed and trained to automatically detect and binarize the markers, allowing for accurate distance analysis over time.

## Why
Monitoring underwater markers is crucial for studying climate change impacts such as rising sea levels, coral degradation, and ecosystem shifts. By analyzing the distance between markers over time, we can gain insights into environmental changes and better understand the effects of climate change on underwater ecosystems.
